# SMD LED Sign Soldering Kit

## Summary
Part of a series of soldering kits developed by The Construct, this kit serves as a good introduction to common SMD components. When complete, the kit can be used as a light-up acrylic sign, with multiple modes of operation.

## Current Release
There are no stable versions for release. The latest WIP is Version 1.1

## Current State
The kit is currently being developed to Version 1.2.

## What's New
Version 1.2 will likely be the first publicly-available version of the kit, implementing a number of changes and improvements;
* Consider swapping to 1206 components, easier for first-time solderers to assemble
* Remove SOT23-5 voltage regulator (testing found it too difficult to solder), also removes the need for logic-level shifting
* Remove the reverse-polarity MOSFET from the power input to reduce part count
* Switch to easier-to-solder SMD LEDs, potentially integrated WS2812-style LEDs to also eliminate the need for the external packaged drivers
* Consider moving the LEDs to the opposite side of the board for a cleaner look/design (will require taller feet for the potentiometers to clear)
* Silkscreen passive component values for easier assembly
* Designate position for JLCPCB identification number
* Replace calibration pot for noise-activated system with something easier to solder
* Consider alternative PCB colors
